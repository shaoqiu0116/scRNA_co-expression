Tissue-specific and cell-specific gene expression can result in the presence or absence of certain protein interactions and complexes, leading to profound tissue-specific and cell-specific functional interaction between these genes. To identify the co-expression patterns of CD44-TRPA1 in mouse tissues, we integrate mouse gene expression data based on scRNA-sequencing from neuronal and non-neuronal tissues to test the possibility of tissue and cell specificity of the CD44-TRPA1 interaction. The co-expression between two genes is often estimated by using the traditional Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs). The Pearson correlation gives an absolute value ranging from 0 to 1. If the absolute value of the correlation is close to 1, then we say that the pair of genes are significantly co-expressed. We evaluate the correlation between the CD44-TRPA1 expression on mouse neuronal and non-neuronal tissues using two differently pre-processed scRNA-seq datasets. Our analysis showed that only DRG tissue had a tissue-specific co-expression correlation (threshold PCC = 0.6) between CD44-TRPA1 in these 20 tissues. Human DRG tissue had a similar co-expression correlation (PCC = 0.55) as mouse DRG. In the nervous system, cell-specific co-expression was present in sensory neurons from the peripheral nervous system. These results suggest a tissue- and cell-specific functional interaction may exist between CD44-TRPA1.
